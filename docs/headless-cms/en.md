description: Learn how to manage an external website or application with Deco
---

At deco.cx, we offer the functionality to create and manage websites intuitively
through the Deco admin. Each page of your site is represented by a set of
structured data in JSON format, capturing all the content present on that page.
All changes made in the content management system (CMS) for a specific page are
immediately reflected in the corresponding JSON of that page. This real-time
update process allows external applications or websites to access and
incorporate these changes, enabling seamless integration between different
systems and environments, including staging and production environments.

The update flow is illustrated in the diagram below:

## Fetching Deco Site Content in External Sites or Applications

To access the content of your Deco site in JSON format from an external site or
application, you can use a simple GET request to the site URL, including an
`asJson` query string.

For example, when accessing the homepage of your storefront site, you will see
the fully rendered page, ready for use, with all visual and interactive
elements:

However, if you want to access only the structured data of the page to use it in
a different context, such as a mobile application or integration with another
system, simply add the query string `?asJson` to the URL. This will result in a
JSON response containing the structured data corresponding to the page's
content, allowing easy integration and manipulation of this data in your
external application:

This "headless" approach to the Deco CMS offers flexibility and power, allowing
you to reuse your site's content in a variety of contexts and platforms.

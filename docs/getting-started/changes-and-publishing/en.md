It's very important to have control and autonomy to manage your pages and blocks and to have the ability to make and undo changes easily if needed. With that in mind, _deco.cx_ allows you to create and manage **environments**.

## See Changes and Publish

When you first create and save your site, you will be in the staging environment, which will hold the changes you make but will not affect the site in production unless you publish these changes.

![Staging environment](/docs/getting-started/changing-and-publishing/staging-env.png)

Let's take a look at the changes we made in this environment. Click the dropdown menu and then select the staging option. You will see this page, showing what was changed compared to the site in production. In our case, we added a new page with a few sections on it. This difference is displayed via JSON, which represents the site's state in a structured way.

From here, you can publish our changes to production by clicking the "Publish now" button or the "Publish" button next to the environment dropdown.

## Create Environments

In addition to the staging environment, you can create additional environments. This is useful for isolating different work from different users, allowing each user to create their own environment and work within it without affecting others or the live site.

### 1. View All Environments

Click the "View all" link in the environment dropdown or go to the Releases tab. This will open the Releases Page, where you can see all environments created for your site as well as the published releases.

### 2. Create a New Environment

Click the "New environment" button.

### 3. Choose a Name and Host

Choose a name for your environment and select the Web option for the host. We will discuss the [localhost option](/docs/getting-started/developing/setup) later.

That's it! You now have your own environment and isolated workspace to make changes to your site. When you're ready to go live, you can publish just like you did with the staging environment.

### 4. Rebasing Your Changes

When publishing with multiple environments, you may need to merge your changes with those made in other environments. For example, if you are editing your site in your new environment, `maria`, while a teammate is editing in the `staging` environment, and your teammate publishes their changes, you will need to rebase your environment to incorporate the new changes now in production. 

In this scenario, instead of seeing the "Publish now" button on the Releases page, you will see a "Rebase" button, as shown below.

![Rebase environment](/docs/getting-started/changing-and-publishing/rebase.png)

Click this button to incorporate the production changes into your environment. After rebasing, you can publish your changes by clicking the "Publish now" button.

   Step-by-step on how to create a Site on deco.cx
---

This documentation will guide you through the process of creating and setting up your first site using Deco.cx. 
A Deco site is the primary asset for Deco users, serving as the hub for creating, editing, and managing their own space on the web.

## 1. Select a Template

Go to the [Deco Admin](https://admin.deco.cx/spaces/new) and select a template to start. In this example, we will choose the landing template, which has the structure and components common to landing pages.

## 2. Explore the Template

Explore the template components and edit them using the live preview. After selecting the template that best fits the site you want to create, you'll be redirected to the website editor. Here, you can modify the site content and structure.

## 3. Save Your Site

Your site will not be yours until you save it to your team! Click on the "Save site to your team" button in the top right corner of the admin page to claim ownership of the site.

You should see something similar to `https://deco-sites-landing.deno.dev/`, which
was the template chosen in the creation process.

### 3.1. Log into the Platform
### 3.2. Give a Name to Your Site and Choose a Team

If you do not have a team yet, one will be created with a name of your choice:

Deco will set up configurations and deploy your site according to the template you chose and the changes you made before saving. Within less than 5 minutes, you'll have a website to call your own.
